  "distribution.body": "1. What Is the Arrest Reward?<br>Purpose of the System<br>The “Arrest Reward” is a mechanism designed to clearly prioritize long-term holders.<br>The achievement of our mission is made possible by those who support the project over the long term.This system is a way to return value to those who continue to support us.<br>This system aims to:<br>Clearly prioritize long-term holders<br>Provide strong incentives not to sell<br>Encourage continued buying as time passes<br>2. How Is the Reward Pool Accumulated?<br>The reward pool operates on an accumulation system.<br>10% of monthly net revenue is allocated to the “Arrest Distribution Pool”<br>No intermediate distributions<br>A one-time distribution occurs upon arrest<br>This means that as time passes, the pool naturally grows, increasing the value of long-term holding.<br>(Visual: A savings box where coins accumulate month by month.)<br>3. Eligibility for Distribution<br>To qualify:<br>You must hold at least 0.1% of the total supply<br>Only holders meeting this threshold are eligible for distribution upon arrest.<br>(Current 0.1% token amount displayed dynamically.)<br>4. Evaluating “Time”: Consecutive Holding Coefficient<br>The core of this system is rewarding consecutive holding duration.<br>Coefficient Table<br>1 month: 1.0<br>2 months: 2.5<br>3 months: 4.0<br>4 months: 5.5<br>5 months: 7.5<br>6+ months: 10.0<br>Rules<br>Monthly snapshot (timing undisclosed)<br>If at any time the requirement is not met (e.g., dropping below 0.1%), the count resets<br>Maximum coefficient reached at 6 months<br>5. Evaluating “Amount”: Holding Ratio Coefficient<br>Holding size is also evaluated, but capped to ensure long-term holders benefit more.<br>(Graph: “Holding Ratio 0.1% → 2% coefficient 1 → 2”)<br>Formula<br>Holding Coefficient (r):<br>HoldingCoefficient(r) = 1 + (r - 0.001) / (0.02 - 0.001)<br>(r = holding ratio, 0.001 = 0.1%, 0.02 = 2%)<br>Graph Labels<br>Title:“Holding Ratio Coefficient Curve (0.1% → 2%)”<br>X-axis: Holding Ratio (%)Y-axis: Holding Coefficient<br>Maximum holding ratio: 2%<br>Maximum coefficient: 2<br>Above 2%, coefficient remains 2<br>This ensures that size alone cannot dominate.<br>6. How Is the Final Distribution Calculated?<br>The process is transparent and simple.<br>Individual Coefficient =Consecutive Holding Coefficient × Holding Ratio Coefficient<br>Individual Share =Individual Coefficient ÷ Total Sum of All Eligible Coefficients<br>Final Distribution =Distribution Pool × Individual Share<br>7. Why Long-Term Holders Are Favored<br>Maximum comparison:<br>Time (Consecutive Holding): 10<br>Amount (Holding Ratio): 2<br>Time : Amount = 10 : 2 = 5 : 1<br>The design is intentional.<br>Money alone cannot win.The greatest reward goes to those who held the longest.<br>8.

Payout share is calculated using both time-held and holding-size coefficients.</div></details><details><summary>15.

Max is 10 at 6+ months.</div></details><details><summary>16. What is the holding ratio coefficient?</summary><div class=\"faq-answer\">A multiplier based on holding size, capped so size alone can’t dominate. Above 2%, the coefficient remains 2.</div></details><details><summary>17. How is my payout calculated?</summary><div class=\"faq-answer\">Individual coefficient (time × size) → share of total coefficients → multiplied by the distribution pool to determine final payout.</div></details><details><summary>18.
