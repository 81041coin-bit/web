  "faq.body": "1. What is 81041?<br>81041 is a project that redirects the reach of meme culture and crypto communities into real-world impact—crime/accident prevention and support for victims. We publish monthly disclosures.<br>2. Is this a charity?<br>No. This is a crypto project that allocates part of its net revenue to social impact (e.g., donations) and publicly reports outcomes.<br>3. What does “50% to social impact” mean?<br>We aim to allocate 50% of net revenue to victim support and crime/accident prevention. Details are disclosed in monthly reports.<br>4. How is the rest of revenue used?<br>Our policy is: Social impact 50%, Operations 40% (development/operations/security), Distribution pool 10% (saved for future payouts under the rules).<br>5. What does “Live Metrics” show?<br>Key indicators such as holders, 24h trades, liquidity, and market cap. Data is fetched from external sources via a relay API and updated at set intervals, with fallbacks if unavailable.<br>6. Is the market data guaranteed to be accurate?<br>No. It’s best-effort reference data and may be delayed or inconsistent. Verify on external sources when needed.<br>7. How do I buy 81041?<br>See the Trade Guide (trade-guide.html). Typical flow: get USDT → swap to SOL → send to an external wallet → swap on a DEX using the contract address.<br>8. Is the referral link/invite code required?<br>No. It may provide benefits, but it’s optional.<br>9. What wallet should I use?<br>Any Solana-compatible wallet (e.g., Phantom). The key is being able to send/receive on the Solana network.<br>10. What is the biggest transfer risk?<br>Selecting the wrong withdrawal network. Always choose Solana and do a small test transfer first.<br>11. Where can I verify the contract address?<br>It’s listed in the Trade Guide. Always confirm the address matches the official one before swapping.<br>12. What is the “Distribution Pool Balance”?<br>It’s the 81041 balance held in a dedicated wallet reserved for payouts, verifiable on-chain.<br>13. When does distribution happen?<br>By design, it’s a one-time distribution “upon arrest.” No interim distributions. See Distribution System (distribution.html).<br>14. Who is eligible?<br>Holding at least 0.1% of total supply is the base requirement. Payout share is calculated using both time-held and holding-size coefficients.<br>15. What is the consecutive holding coefficient?<br>A multiplier that rewards uninterrupted holding duration. If you drop below the threshold even once, it resets. Max is 10 at 6+ months.<br>16. What is the holding ratio coefficient?<br>A multiplier based on holding size, capped so size alone can’t dominate. Above 2%, the coefficient remains 2.<br>17. How is my payout calculated?<br>Individual coefficient (time × size) → share of total coefficients → multiplied by the distribution pool to determine final payout.<br>18. What’s on Results (results.html)?<br>An archive of social impact records (recipient, amount, date, intended use), with evidence links when available.<br>19. What’s on Reports (report.html)?<br>Monthly summaries of revenue/expenses and allocations (support, operations, saved pool) to increase transparency.<br>20. Can I donate directly?<br>Yes. We provide links to official donation pages. If you want to support victims, direct donation is recommended.<br>21. Where can I submit information about unsolved cases?<br>We provide links to official public channels. In emergencies, contact local emergency services first.<br>22. Is this investment advice?<br>No. This site is informational only. Crypto carries risk, and decisions are your responsibility.<br>23. Where can I read about the hack/backstory?<br>The Home prologue summarizes it, and reports may provide further factual updates and actions taken.<br>24. Where are the official communities?<br>Use the footer links to official X / Telegram / Discord. Beware of impersonators.<br>25. Where are Privacy/Terms/Disclaimer?<br>They’re linked in the footer: Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, and Disclaimer.",

Wouldn’t direct donations or petitions be enough?” Indeed, conventional methods have their value. However, modern criminal investigations—especially the pursuit of wanted fugitives—face structural barriers that traditional approaches cannot overcome.</p><p><strong>Limitations of Existing Systems</strong></p><p><strong>The Absolute Barrier of Overseas Escape</strong><br>Once a suspect flees abroad, law enforcement options become severely restricted. Physical and legal borders obstruct the realization of justice. International cooperation requires time and cost, and depending on the country of refuge, effective pursuit may become practically impossible.</p><p><strong>Public Concern Cannot Be Converted Into Sustained Force</strong><br>Even when citizens feel strongly about an issue, there are few mechanisms to transform that concern into continuous pressure or actionable support. Petitions gather signatures but rarely lead to sustained action. Donations are temporary, fading as public attention declines. Public will does not translate into lasting impact.</p><p><strong>What Only a Meme Coin Can Achieve</strong></p><p><strong>Borderless Virality</strong><br>The spread of meme coins surpasses that of any conventional campaign. Once attention is gained, the coin’s name and symbol can propagate globally within 24 hours—across English-speaking regions, Asia, Europe, and anywhere a fugitive might hide. This scale is unattainable through domestic media or traditional fundraising alone.</p><p><strong>Automated, Continuous Funding Flow</strong><br>Transaction activity generates ongoing fees as long as the project exists. Unlike one-time fundraising campaigns, financial support for victim assistance and information awareness can continue indefinitely. Sustained interest directly becomes sustained funding.</p><p><strong>Transparency as the Foundation of Trust</strong><br>All transactions on the blockchain are publicly verifiable—anyone, anytime, anywhere.</p><p><strong>Low Barrier to Participation</strong><br>Anyone in the world can join this movement within seconds using only a smartphone. This accessibility enables true global civic collaboration.</p><p><strong>A Goal Achievable Only Through This Project</strong><br>This initiative simultaneously addresses two fundamental challenges in criminal investigations: overseas evasion and the fragmentation of civic engagement. It seeks to create cross-border solidarity and a sustainable support infrastructure that traditional methods could never realize. That is why this project adopts the form of a meme coin.</p><p><strong>2. Transforming the Role of Meme Coins</strong></p><p><strong>The Structural Problems of Today’s Meme Coin Market</strong><br>The current meme coin landscape faces serious issues:</p><p>Extreme volatility driven by short-term speculation<br>Lack of tangible social value<br>Opaque profit structures benefiting only creators<br>Communities that disappear after temporary hype</p><p>Despite their powerful reach and community-building potential, most meme coins remain entertainment-driven and rarely produce meaningful societal contributions. We confront this problem directly.</p><p><strong>The True Potential of Blockchain</strong><br>Blockchain technology enables complete visibility of financial flows, allowing anyone to verify them independently.</p><p><strong>Transparency as a Revolution</strong><br>This transparency solves a fundamental issue in traditional fundraising: uncertainty about how funds are used. Every transaction is permanently recorded and verifiable in real time by anyone in the world—an unprecedented level of financial accountability.</p><p><strong>Establishing a Replicable Model</strong><br>We aim to become the first real-world example of combining technology and civic participation to address social challenges. This project demonstrates that digital assets can function not only as speculative instruments but also as effective tools for public good. If successful, this framework can extend to other causes—unsolved cases, environmental protection, education, medical access—areas often neglected because they are not profit-driven. It represents a new category: Social Meme Coins.</p><p>We believe the viral power of crypto can be used for something more meaningful. When people around the world unite for a shared purpose, that force can influence even governments and large institutions. This is not merely an investment vehicle. It is a movement toward a safer and more just society.</p><p><strong>From Meme to Movement</strong></p>",
