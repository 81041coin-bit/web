Open \"Buy Crypto\" in the app<br>2. Select \"USDT\" as the currency to buy<br>3. Choose \"Credit/Debit Card\" as payment method<br>4. Enter the amount and tap the purchase button<br>5. Once USDT appears in your balance, proceed to next step<br>[Reference Image] Buy Crypto screen showing payment method selection<br>[Note]<br>This method is convenient but tends to have higher fees.<br>We recommend starting with a small amount.<br>■ Route B: P2P Trading (Cost-effective Method)<br>────────────────────────────────────<br>Steps:<br>1.

Send USDT to your external wallet<br>2.

What Is the Arrest Reward?<br>Purpose of the System<br>The “Arrest Reward” is a mechanism designed to clearly prioritize long-term holders.<br>The achievement of our mission is made possible by those who support the project over the long term.This system is a way to return value to those who continue to support us.<br>This system aims to:<br>Clearly prioritize long-term holders<br>Provide strong incentives not to sell<br>Encourage continued buying as time passes<br>2. How Is the Reward Pool Accumulated?<br>The reward pool operates on an accumulation system.<br>10% of monthly net revenue is allocated to the “Arrest Distribution Pool”<br>No intermediate distributions<br>A one-time distribution occurs upon arrest<br>This means that as time passes, the pool naturally grows, increasing the value of long-term holding.<br>(Visual: A savings box where coins accumulate month by month.)<br>3.

  "faq.body": "1. What is 81041?<br>81041 is a project that redirects the reach of meme culture and crypto communities into real-world impact—crime/accident prevention and support for victims. We publish monthly disclosures.<br>2. Is this a charity?<br>No. This is a crypto project that allocates part of its net revenue to social impact (e.g., donations) and publicly reports outcomes.<br>3. What does “50% to social impact” mean?<br>We aim to allocate 50% of net revenue to victim support and crime/accident prevention. Details are disclosed in monthly reports.<br>4. How is the rest of revenue used?<br>Our policy is: Social impact 50%, Operations 40% (development/operations/security), Distribution pool 10% (saved for future payouts under the rules).<br>5. What does “Live Metrics” show?<br>Key indicators such as holders, 24h trades, liquidity, and market cap. Data is fetched from external sources via a relay API and updated at set intervals, with fallbacks if unavailable.<br>6. Is the market data guaranteed to be accurate?<br>No. It’s best-effort reference data and may be delayed or inconsistent. Verify on external sources when needed.<br>7. How do I buy 81041?<br>See the Trade Guide (trade-guide.html). Typical flow: get USDT → swap to SOL → send to an external wallet → swap on a DEX using the contract address.<br>8. Is the referral link/invite code required?<br>No. It may provide benefits, but it’s optional.<br>9. What wallet should I use?<br>Any Solana-compatible wallet (e.g., Phantom). The key is being able to send/receive on the Solana network.<br>10. What is the biggest transfer risk?<br>Selecting the wrong withdrawal network. Always choose Solana and do a small test transfer first.<br>11. Where can I verify the contract address?<br>It’s listed in the Trade Guide. Always confirm the address matches the official one before swapping.<br>12. What is the “Distribution Pool Balance”?<br>It’s the 81041 balance held in a dedicated wallet reserved for payouts, verifiable on-chain.<br>13. When does distribution happen?<br>By design, it’s a one-time distribution “upon arrest.” No interim distributions. See Distribution System (distribution.html).<br>14. Who is eligible?<br>Holding at least 0.1% of total supply is the base requirement. Payout share is calculated using both time-held and holding-size coefficients.<br>15. What is the consecutive holding coefficient?<br>A multiplier that rewards uninterrupted holding duration. If you drop below the threshold even once, it resets. Max is 10 at 6+ months.<br>16. What is the holding ratio coefficient?<br>A multiplier based on holding size, capped so size alone can’t dominate. Above 2%, the coefficient remains 2.<br>17. How is my payout calculated?<br>Individual coefficient (time × size) → share of total coefficients → multiplied by the distribution pool to determine final payout.<br>18. What’s on Results (results.html)?<br>An archive of social impact records (recipient, amount, date, intended use), with evidence links when available.<br>19. What’s on Reports (report.html)?<br>Monthly summaries of revenue/expenses and allocations (support, operations, saved pool) to increase transparency.<br>20. Can I donate directly?<br>Yes. We provide links to official donation pages. If you want to support victims, direct donation is recommended.<br>21. Where can I submit information about unsolved cases?<br>We provide links to official public channels. In emergencies, contact local emergency services first.<br>22. Is this investment advice?<br>No. This site is informational only. Crypto carries risk, and decisions are your responsibility.<br>23. Where can I read about the hack/backstory?<br>The Home prologue summarizes it, and reports may provide further factual updates and actions taken.<br>24. Where are the official communities?<br>Use the footer links to official X / Telegram / Discord. Beware of impersonators.<br>25. Where are Privacy/Terms/Disclaimer?<br>They’re linked in the footer: Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, and Disclaimer.",
