# Questions

1. Live Market Data chart: which external chart widget/provider and the exact "外部で見る" URL should we use?
2. "アイコン" is listed in the spec, but no asset or usage is defined. What icon file (or text) should be used, and where should it appear?
3. Distribution page: "現在の0.1％が何枚かを表で表す（自動更新）" — what data source should be used to compute total supply (or the 0.1% token amount), and what exact format should the table use?
4. `/api/geo`: which hosting platform is assumed (Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare/etc.) so I can read the correct country header?
5. Index page "概要（About/Mission）" section: no copy is provided in the spec. What exact text (ja/zh/en) should be displayed there?
